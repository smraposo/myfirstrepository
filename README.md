###Intro to this Repo

In this repo, I've created 2 branches: master and hellobranchA.

You'll also find a file called 'hellodoc.txt'. I edited this file throughout while learning how to commit, create branches, switch between branches, and merge.

Master and hellobranchA should match because I've merged them.
